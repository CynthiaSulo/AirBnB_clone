Project Description:

The AirBnB_clone project centers around the creation of a command interpreter. This interpreter facilitates the management of objects through commands entered via the console or command interpreter. 

Description of the Command Interpreter:

Getting Started:
To initiate the console, execute the console.py file as follows: "./console.py"

How to Utilize It:
The console operates by receiving commands in the following formats:
- "command {class_name}"
- "{class_name}.command()"

Examples:
Below are instances illustrating how to issue various available commands:
- Create an object of class BaseModel: "create BaseModel" or "BaseModel.create()"
- Display details of a BaseModel object by its ID: "show BaseModel BaseModel.id" or "BaseModel.show(BaseModel.id)"
